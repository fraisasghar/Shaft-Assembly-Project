## 2. Objectives
The primary objectives of this design project were:
- **Precision Modeling:** To develop a high-fidelity 3D model of a mechanical shaft with varying diameters and stepped sections.
- **Technical Interpretation:** To accurately translate complex orthographic dimensions into a 3D isometric representation.
- **Design for Assembly (DFA):** To ensure proper tolerance and alignment between the shaft and the green support housing.
- **Geometric Fidelity:** To apply specific radii (R) and hole diameters (Φ) as dictated by engineering specifications.

##  Component Analysis

#### 3.1 Stepped Mechanical Shaft
The shaft is the primary rotating or load-bearing element. It features:
- **Flange Section:** A R5.07 mounting flange that interfaces with the support bracket.
- **Transition Zones:** Smooth transitions between sections to reduce stress concentration.
- **Keyed/D-Cut Profile:** A functional end section with an R0.07 radius and a 0.07mm offset flat surface, designed for torque transmission or specific orientation.
- **Dimensional Accuracy:** Total functional length measured at Φ60.06mm, with sub-sections of Φ43.03mm and Φ63.01mm.

#### 3.2 Support Bracket
The green support component serves as the stationary base:
- **Hole Geometry:** Includes two Φ0.07 mounting holes positioned with a Φ60.07mm span.
- **Structural Support:** Features a Φ38.22mm height with a central bore to accommodate the hexagonal/rounded interface of the shaft.

## Technical Specifications

| Feature | Dimension (mm) |
|---------|---------------|
| Main Flange Diameter | R5.07 |
| Support Hole Spacing | Φ60.07 |
| Shaft Total Length | Φ60.06 |
| Support Height | Φ38.22 |
| End Radius | R0.07 |
| Flat Surface Offset | 0.07 |



## ⚙️ Design Methodology

The development process was conducted through the following stages:

1. **Drafting & Sketching:** Initial 2D profiles were created for the support bracket and the shaft cross-sections.
2. **Extrusion & Revolution:** The bracket was created via linear extrusion, while the shaft utilized both revolutionary and additive extrusion techniques.
3. **Refinement:** Fillets and radii (R0.07 on the bracket corners) were applied to ensure ergonomic handling and mechanical durability.
4. **Verification:** A final check of the Φ43.03mm, Φ63.01mm, and Φ38.22mm clearance dimensions was performed to confirm assembly fitment.
